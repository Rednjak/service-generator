### Purpose

This folder is highly individual and should be adapted according to the deployment system(CI/CD) withing your own organization.

Currently only the dev folder contains two sub-folders. One containing the server specific dependencies that you would need and a go folder where we can build an example image that we would be running in Kubernetes. Please note that the image itself is not production ready and should be adapted.
